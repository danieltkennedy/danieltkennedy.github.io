I am a theoretical physicist interested in plasmas physics, particularly with an astrophysical spin. Currently, I am a final year graduate student under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Per Helander at the Max-Planck-Institue for Plasma Physics. 



Research Interests
------

My research interests include general plasma physics, plasma astrophysics and astrophysical gas dynamics. 

My current work as a theoretical physicist focuses on the kinetic theory of electron-positron plasmas. During my PhD project, I have been responsible for a number of subprojects, which has allowed me to investigate areas of plasma physics such as the stability and equilibria of non-neutral plasmas. I am currently working on the effects of cyclotron-cooling, anisotropy and collisions in models of electron-positron plasmas, investigating how this can impede or enhance the stability of laboratory borne pair  plasmas. I am keen to expand on my PhD work along an astrophysical axis and I am particularly interested in the behaviour of electron-positron plasmas in pulsar magnetospheres.

I have directed my research to enable me to utilise both analytic calculations and numerical simulations. With a solid grounding in both methods, I have a strong preference for the former. However, I have found the incorporation of numerical simulations and calculations in my work extremely valuable and a large part of my PhD work has been centred around gyrokinetic simulations of electron-positron plasmas in closed field-line geometry. I believe learning new techniques and trying new ideas is a central part of furthering and improving my research and I have experience using both Eulerian and Particle-In-Cell codes.

Biography
------

Previous to my doctoral training, I read for a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, followed by a masters degree in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics at [Merton College](https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford. I graduate with distinction from the MMathPhys program in the summer of 2017.

As an undergraduate in mathematics, I applied myself to large variety of courses, ranging from Rings and Modules to Applied Partial Differential Equations, Electromagnetism, Viscous Flow and Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations. As part of the MMathPhys program I specialised in plasma physics and astrophysical gas dynamics, taking numerous courses in these areas. In addition to the advanced plasma physics courses I took in my final year.

I studied Astrophysical Gas Dynamics under Prof. Steven Balbus, which culminated in a dissertation on “The Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability in the presence of background magnetic fields.” Here, I expanded my learning beyond the parameters of the university mathematics course, allowing me to delve into exciting areas in astrophysical fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics and plasma physics. This experience bolstered my interest in pursuing further study in these areas.

During my time at Oxford, I received a number of prizes for my academic writing and excellent performance in University examinations. On several occasions I have also secured competitive funding and grant money to undertake summer research placements and travel to conferences.

Previous Research Experience 
------

I have been chosen to undertake several paid positions in various groups of the Mathematics and Physics departments at the University of Oxford. In total, I have been selected for four research internships, each of which has led to publications and long lasting collaborations. One such position was a research project in the Oxford department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics, which focused on atmospheric dynamics (specifically high pressure blocking systems). Here, I gained extensive research experience, which has been invaluable to my subsequent work. The project work emphasised computation, requiring me to write numerous computer programs. This allowed me to use my knowledge of statistics to analyse large data sets, for example, writing Monte-Carlo simulations to preform statistical significance tests. I was also required to use my knowledge of fluid mechanics and atmospheric dynamics to attempt to describe and explain the results of the numerical computations, backing these predictions up with more data analysis. I expanded and consolidated my knowledge by attending numerous seminars and colloquia on astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics throughout these projects, as well as engaging in many stimulating conversations with leading academics in other fields.
